# Simple Biometric Extension

A simple extension for the Fingkey Hamster biometric device, utilizing the eNBioBSP SDK for seamless integration.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main components:

- **`extension`**: A browser extension that renders information on web pages and communicates with the native app to request biometric data.
- **`native-app`**: A system-native application that interfaces directly with the user's machine and the connected biometric device. It is installed and updated by the browser extension.

This project aims to provide a streamlined solution for integrating biometric authentication into web applications.
